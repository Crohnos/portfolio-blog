<p>Company merchandise is more than just branded swag—it&#39;s a tangible expression of company culture and team unity. However, distributing company merchandise efficiently within an organization presents unique challenges that off-the-shelf e-commerce solutions don&#39;t adequately address. This is what led me to build a specialized Internal Merchandise Store application.</p>
<h2>The Problem It Solves</h2>
<p>Before implementing this solution, the company&#39;s merchandise distribution process was fragmented and inefficient:</p>
<ol>
<li>Merchandise requests were handled through email or spreadsheet forms</li>
<li>Inventory tracking was manual and often inaccurate</li>
<li>The finance department struggled to properly account for merchandise costs</li>
<li>Employees had no easy way to browse available items</li>
<li>Distribution relied on physical handoffs and manual record-keeping</li>
</ol>
<p>The Internal Merchandise Store addresses these pain points by providing:</p>
<ul>
<li>A centralized platform for browsing and ordering company merchandise</li>
<li>Automated inventory tracking and management</li>
<li>Integration with payroll for seamless deduction processing</li>
<li>An admin dashboard for merchandise management and order fulfillment</li>
<li>Role-based access control for different administrative functions</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technical Design Decisions</h2>
<h3>Why React + TypeScript Frontend</h3>
<p>I chose React for the frontend because of its component-based architecture, which allowed for rapid development and easy maintenance. The decision to use TypeScript was driven by the need for reliability in an internal business application:</p>
<ol>
<li>Type safety prevents common runtime errors</li>
<li>Interface definitions create clear contracts between components</li>
<li>Better IDE integration improves developer productivity</li>
<li>Self-documenting code reduces maintenance burden</li>
</ol>
<p>This combination provided the perfect balance of development speed and application reliability, especially important for an internal tool that needs to &quot;just work&quot; without dedicated support staff.</p>
<h3>Lightweight CSS with PicoCSS</h3>
<p>Rather than implement a heavy UI framework like Material UI or Bootstrap, I opted for PicoCSS—a minimalist CSS framework that provides sensible defaults while staying out of the way. This decision:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reduced bundle size for better performance</li>
<li>Avoided framework lock-in and unnecessary complexity</li>
<li>Allowed for rapid styling without fighting against a framework&#39;s opinions</li>
<li>Created a clean, professional interface without excessive styling</li>
</ol>
<p>The resulting UI is straightforward and functional—exactly what&#39;s needed for an internal business application.</p>
<h3>Express + SQLite Backend</h3>
<p>The backend architecture prioritizes simplicity and maintainability over cutting-edge features. Express provides a familiar, well-documented API framework, while SQLite offers a lightweight database solution that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Requires no separate database server</li>
<li>Simplifies deployment and backups</li>
<li>Provides sufficient performance for the expected load</li>
<li>Offers full relational database capabilities without administration overhead</li>
</ol>
<p>For an internal application with predictable usage patterns, this stack provides all the necessary functionality without unnecessary operational complexity.</p>
<h3>TypeScript Across the Stack</h3>
<p>Using TypeScript on both frontend and backend created a cohesive development experience with shared type definitions. This approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensures API contracts are consistently enforced</li>
<li>Reduces errors when passing data between systems</li>
<li>Improves developer confidence when making changes</li>
<li>Creates natural documentation through type annotations</li>
</ol>
<p>The result is a more maintainable codebase that future developers can confidently modify without fear of breaking changes.</p>
<h2>Challenges Encountered</h2>
<h3>Role-Based Access Control</h3>
<p>One of the most complex aspects of the application was implementing appropriate role-based access control. The store needed different permission levels for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular employees (browsing and ordering only)</li>
<li>Merchandise managers (inventory and catalog management)</li>
<li>Order fulfillment staff (order processing and status updates)</li>
<li>Administrators (user management and reporting)</li>
</ul>
<p>The solution involved creating a flexible permission system with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hierarchical roles with inheritance</li>
<li>Granular permissions that can be assigned to roles</li>
<li>Route-level middleware for access control</li>
<li>Component-level conditional rendering based on permissions</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach ensures that users only see and access functionality relevant to their role while keeping the authorization logic manageable.</p>
<h3>Inventory Availability Logic</h3>
<p>Another challenging aspect was managing inventory availability across different office locations with varying item types and sizes. The data model needed to account for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Multiple physical locations with separate inventories</li>
<li>Items with size variations (e.g., S, M, L, XL for clothing)</li>
<li>Limited-edition items with restricted availability</li>
<li>Reserved items awaiting pickup</li>
</ol>
<p>I implemented a flexible availability system that tracks inventory at the intersection of item, size, and location. This allowed for precise inventory control while providing employees with accurate availability information when ordering.</p>
<h3>Order Processing Workflow</h3>
<p>Creating an efficient order processing workflow required careful consideration of the physical fulfillment process. The system needed to track orders through multiple states:</p>
<ol>
<li>Submitted (initial state)</li>
<li>Processing (picked for fulfillment)</li>
<li>Ready for pickup (awaiting employee collection)</li>
<li>Completed (delivered to employee)</li>
<li>Canceled (either by employee or administrator)</li>
</ol>
<p>Each state transition triggered appropriate notifications and inventory updates, ensuring that the digital and physical processes remained synchronized.</p>
<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
<p>While the current implementation successfully addresses the core requirements, several enhancements could further improve the system:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Integration with HR Systems</strong>: Automatically updating employee information and department allocations</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Analytics Dashboard</strong>: Providing insights into popular items and ordering patterns</li>
<li><strong>Budget Management</strong>: Allowing departments to set and track merchandise budgets</li>
<li><strong>Event-Based Collections</strong>: Creating limited-time merchandise collections tied to company events</li>
<li><strong>Mobile App</strong>: Developing a companion mobile application for easier browsing and order tracking</li>
</ol>
<p>The modular architecture was designed with these potential enhancements in mind, allowing for incremental improvements without major refactoring.</p>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>This project reinforced several important principles about building internal business applications:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Focus on user workflows, not just features</strong>: Understanding how employees and administrators actually work led to more intuitive interfaces.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Simplicity trumps sophistication</strong>: Choosing simpler technologies that just work proved more valuable than implementing cutting-edge solutions.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Performance matters even for internal tools</strong>: Employees have limited patience for slow applications, even when they&#39;re required to use them.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Admin interfaces deserve thoughtful design</strong>: Administrative users spend significant time in the system and benefit greatly from well-designed interfaces.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Internal Merchandise Store has transformed what was once an administrative burden into a streamlined, enjoyable process for both employees and administrators. By understanding the specific needs of an internal merchandise distribution system rather than forcing a generic e-commerce solution to fit, the application delivers exactly what the company needed—no more, no less.</p>
