# About John Graham

I'm a web developer and software engineer with a passion for building applications that solve real-world problems. My journey in tech began after transitioning from a career in IT audit, and I've never looked back.

## My Background

After studying Accounting and Information Systems, I started my career in IT audit at a major consulting firm. While the experience was valuable, I quickly realized my true passion was in building technology, not just evaluating it. This led me to pivot into software development, where I could directly create solutions to the problems I was seeing.

## Technical Skills

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, SQL Server, SQLite
- **Tools**: Git, Docker, VS Code
- **Other**: Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure), CI/CD, Testing

## Project Philosophy

I believe in building applications that:

1. **Solve real problems** - Technology should address actual user needs
2. **Prioritize user experience** - Clean, intuitive interfaces make all the difference
3. **Maintain code quality** - Well-structured code ensures maintainability
4. **Use the right tools** - Choosing appropriate technologies for each specific challenge

## Featured Projects

Some of my recent work includes:

- **AI Author**: An interactive story generator built with React, TypeScript, and AI integration
- **Community Aid Center Inventory Management System**: A specialized inventory solution for non-profits
- **Internal Merchandise Store**: A company swag distribution platform
- **Job Application Tracker**: A tool helping job seekers organize their search process

You can find more details about these projects in my blog posts.

## Beyond Coding

When I'm not coding, I enjoy:

- Reading about emerging technologies
- Contributing to open-source projects
- Outdoor activities to disconnect from screens
- Exploring new music and podcasts
