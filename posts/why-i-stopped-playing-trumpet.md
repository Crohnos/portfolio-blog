# Harry Potter and The Reason I Stopped Playing Trumpet

After dedicating over 15 years of my life to the trumpet, including four years of music school and countless performances, I made the difficult decision to put my horn in its case for good. This wasn't a choice I made lightly, but rather one that developed gradually through a combination of physical challenges, health issues, and a realization about the musical environment I was in.

## My Journey with the Trumpet

Before I explain why I stopped, let me share a bit about my relationship with the trumpet. I started playing when I was 10 years old, instantly falling in love with the instrument's bright, powerful sound. By high school, I was practicing 3-4 hours daily, performed with honor bands, and eventually earned a scholarship to study music performance at university.

The trumpet became central to my identity. I dreamed of playing professionally in orchestras, studio sessions, or jazz ensembles. My practice routine was sacred, and the progress I made on challenging pieces brought me genuine joy.

## The Physical Toll of Brass Playing

### The Unexpected Battle with Cold Sores

One of the first major obstacles I faced was recurring cold sores (herpes labialis). For non-brass players, this might sound like a minor inconvenience, but for trumpeters, it can be debilitating:

1. **Direct Impact on Playing**: The trumpet mouthpiece must form a seal with the lips exactly where cold sores typically appear
2. **Extended Recovery Time**: Playing would aggravate and extend healing time from 1 week to 3+ weeks
3. **Performance Anxiety**: The stress of important performances would trigger outbreaks, creating a vicious cycle
4. **Professional Reliability**: Missing rehearsals or performances due to cold sores damaged my reputation as a reliable player

I tried everything:
- **Prescription medications** (Valtrex, acyclovir)
- **Lysine supplements** and dietary changes
- **Special mouthpieces** with different rim designs
- **Preventative treatments** like Abreva at the first tingle

Despite these efforts, the problem persisted and worsened over time. Having to cancel performances or struggle through them in extreme pain became a regular occurrence.

## TMJ: The Final Physical Straw

As if cold sores weren't enough, I began developing temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder in my final year of music school:

The symptoms included:
- **Clicking and popping** in my jaw joint during playing
- **Facial pain** that would radiate from my jaw to my temples
- **Limited jaw movement** that affected my embouchure flexibility
- **Muscle fatigue** after even short practice sessions

The cause? Years of:
- **Embouchure tension**: The trumpet requires significant pressure and tension
- **Extended playing**: Long rehearsals and practice sessions
- **Dental changes**: Wisdom teeth and orthodontic work
- **Stress-related jaw clenching**: Especially before performances

Treatment options were limited:
- **Physical therapy**: Provided temporary relief but not a solution
- **Night guards**: Helped with nighttime clenching but not playing-related issues
- **Reduced playing time**: Directly conflicted with my professional aspirations
- **Technique modification**: Limited my range and endurance

## Beyond Physical Challenges: The Culture of Classical Music

While physical issues may have been the immediate cause, there was a deeper reason I stepped away from trumpet playing: the often toxic culture I experienced in high-level music environments.

### The Psychological Toll

The world of classical music performance, particularly in brass instruments, often fostered:

1. **Extreme Competitiveness**: Even among friends and colleagues
   ```
   "There are 100 players waiting to take your chair if you can't handle it."
   — A professor I had in music school
   ```

2. **Psychological Pressure**: Constant scrutiny where one bad performance could damage your reputation

3. **Endless Perfectionism**: Never being satisfied, always focusing on what went wrong

4. **Identity Fusion**: Your worth as a person becoming tied to your playing ability

5. **Financial Instability**: The reality of low pay and job scarcity creating additional stress

### The Culture of Stoicism

There was an unwritten rule in the trumpet world: play through the pain. This manifested as:

| Expected Behavior | Actual Impact |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Practice regardless of physical discomfort | Worsening of physical conditions |
| Never complain about pain or difficulty | Delayed seeking proper medical help |
| Hide vulnerabilities from peers and teachers | Isolation during struggles |
| Prioritize performance commitments over health | Long-term damage to playing ability |

This mentality particularly affected brass players, who often pride themselves on toughness and resilience.

## The Breaking Point

During my final recital preparation in music school, everything came to a head. I was experiencing:

- TMJ pain so severe I couldn't play for more than 20 minutes
- A stress-induced cold sore outbreak two weeks before the recital
- Anxiety attacks during practice sessions
- Constant feelings of inadequacy despite positive feedback

I pushed through the recital, but something fundamentally changed. The joy was gone, replaced by dread and physical pain. I realized I had to make a choice between my health and my musical aspirations.

## Life After the Trumpet

Making the decision to stop playing professionally wasn't immediate but gradual:

1. **Initial Break**: Taking a "temporary" break to heal physically
2. **Perspective Shift**: Using the time away to reassess my relationship with music
3. **Identity Reclamation**: Discovering who I was outside of being "a trumpet player"
4. **New Creative Outlets**: Finding ways to stay musical without the physical toll

The unexpected result? A profound sense of relief and renewed love for music—just in different ways. Now I:

- **Listen more**: Without the critical "how would I play this" lens
- **Explore other instruments**: Piano and guitar don't trigger my TMJ
- **Enjoy music technology**: Recording and production have become new creative outlets
- **Still contribute**: Teaching and mentoring young musicians without the performance pressure

## Lessons Learned

My journey away from the trumpet taught me valuable lessons:

1. **Physical health must come first** in any passion or profession
2. **Professional culture matters** as much as the activity itself
3. **Adaptation is not failure** but a form of wisdom
4. **Identity is fluid** and can evolve beyond our initial dreams
5. **Joy should remain central** to our relationship with music

## To Those Struggling

If you're a musician facing similar challenges, I want you to know:

- It's okay to prioritize your health and happiness
- Your worth isn't tied to your ability to play an instrument
- There are many ways to keep music in your life
- The skills you've gained as a musician transfer to other areas

Taking care of your physical and mental health isn't giving up—it's making space for a sustainable relationship with music that can last a lifetime, even if it looks different than you initially imagined.
