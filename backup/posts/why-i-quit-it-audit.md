# Reason I Quit IT Audit

Three years ago, I was sitting in a beige conference room reviewing yet another spreadsheet of control matrices when I had a realization: I was deeply, profoundly unfulfilled. Despite the respectable salary, clear career path, and stability that my IT audit position at a Big Four firm offered, I felt increasingly disconnected from the work I was doing. Six months later, I quit to become a programmer—a decision that transformed my professional life and reignited my sense of purpose.

## My Journey Into (and Out of) IT Audit

Like many accounting and finance graduates, I was recruited into the IT audit world with promises of:

- A prestigious firm name on my resume
- Clear promotion timelines
- Work-life balance (compared to financial audit)
- Technology exposure without needing to be a "techie"

The reality, however, looked quite different once I was in the role.

### The Day-to-Day Reality

My typical day as an IT audit senior looked something like this (forgive me, I'm going to experiment with a Markdown 'Mermaid' diagram here):

<div class="mermaid">
graph TD
    A[Document review meeting: 9-10:30am] --> B[Update control matrices: 10:30am-12pm]
    B --> C[Lunch while catching up on emails: 12-1pm]
    C --> D[Client follow-up calls: 1-3pm]
    D --> E[Prepare status updates for managers: 3-4:30pm]
    E --> F[Team check-in/planning: 4:30-5pm]
    F --> G[Address review notes: 5-7pm]
</div>

On paper, this seems structured and manageable. In practice, it involved:

1. **Endless documentation**: Producing and reviewing enormous volumes of standardized documents
2. **Limited technical depth**: Scratching the surface of technologies without truly understanding them
3. **Checkbox mentality**: Focusing on compliance rather than real security or improvement
4. **Disconnection from impact**: Rarely seeing how our work affected actual systems or users

> "There's a special kind of dread that comes from knowing exactly what your career will look like in 5, 10, and 15 years—and realizing you don't want any of those futures." 

### The Breaking Point

Several key moments led to my eventual decision to leave:

#### The Midnight Revelation

During a particularly grueling busy season, I found myself at midnight updating a spreadsheet tracking other spreadsheets. The absurdity of my situation suddenly hit me: I was using my limited time on Earth to track documentation about documentation.

#### The Technical Frustration

I kept encountering technical issues that fascinated me, but my role limited me to documenting them rather than solving them:

| What I Was Asked to Do | What I Wanted to Do |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Document that a vulnerability existed | Figure out how to fix it |
| Verify that a change management process was followed | Understand how the changes actually worked |
| Ensure server configurations matched documentation | Explore why those configurations mattered |
| Test that access controls existed | Design better security systems |

#### The Career Ceiling

While discussing my future with a partner at the firm, I realized that even at the highest levels, the work remained fundamentally the same—just with more client management and less direct technical involvement. The ceiling wasn't just about advancement; it was about the nature of the work itself.

## The Mental Transition to Programming

Leaving a stable, prestigious career wasn't a decision I made lightly. I went through several phases of consideration:

### 1. The Exploration Phase

I began exploring programming outside of work:

- Completing online courses after hours (starting with Python)
- Building small tools to automate parts of my audit work
- Reading about different development careers
- Connecting with friends who had made similar transitions

### 2. The Cost-Benefit Analysis

I created a realistic assessment of what the transition would involve:

| Factor | IT Audit | Programming |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Initial Salary | $85,000 | $60,000 (entry level) |
| Long-term Earning Potential | $150,000-200,000 | Potentially $200,000+ |
| Job Security | High | Moderate to High |
| Required Retraining | None | 6-12 months |
| Work Satisfaction | Low | Unknown (hopefully high) |
| Daily Variety | Low | High |
| Creative Freedom | Very Low | Moderate to High |
| Growth Trajectory | Linear, Predictable | Varied, Skill-Based |

### 3. The Test Run

Before fully committing, I created a 3-month trial:

```markdown
# My Programming Trial Plan

## Goals
- Build a functional web application
- Complete at least one technical interview
- Determine if I genuinely enjoy the work

## Schedule
- Weekdays: 2 hours before work (5-7am)
- Weekends: 6 hours each day
- Total: 22 hours/week for 12 weeks

## Curriculum
- Complete a full-stack web development course
- Build a portfolio project
- Start interviewing for junior positions
```

This test period was crucial—it helped me discover that despite the challenges of learning, I consistently looked forward to my programming time in a way I never did with audit work.

## Making the Leap: The Practical Transition

### Financial Preparation

Knowing I'd likely take a pay cut and need time for training, I prepared financially:

1. **Built an emergency fund** covering 12 months of expenses
2. **Reduced fixed costs** by moving to a less expensive apartment
3. **Calculated my "runway"** for a worst-case job search scenario
4. **Created a budget** for bootcamp/education expenses

### Education Choices

After researching different learning paths, I chose a hybrid approach:

- **Self-study**: Using platforms like freeCodeCamp and Udemy
- **Structured learning**: A 12-week intensive bootcamp
- **Project-based practice**: Building real applications to solidify skills
- **Community involvement**: Joining local coding meetups

### The Job Search Reality

The transition wasn't without challenges. My job search statistics tell the story:

- **Applications submitted**: 87
- **Initial responses**: 28
- **Technical interviews**: 12
- **Final round interviews**: 6
- **Offers received**: 2
- **Time from first application to accepted offer**: 3.5 months

The most common rejection reason? "We're looking for someone with more direct programming experience." Overcoming this catch-22 of needing experience to get experience was perhaps the biggest hurdle.

## Life as a Developer: The Other Side

After securing my first junior developer position, the contrast with my audit career became immediately apparent:

### Tangible Creation vs. Documentation

```javascript
// The simple joy of building something that works
function calculateTotal(items) {
  return items.reduce((total, item) => {
    return total + (item.price * item.quantity);
  }, 0);
}

// Seeing immediate results from your work
console.log(calculateTotal(cart)); // $127.94
```

There's something profoundly satisfying about creating something functional rather than just documenting what exists. Each day now involves building solutions rather than cataloging problems.

### Continuous Learning vs. Procedural Repetition

My professional development has completely transformed:

| IT Audit Learning | Programming Learning |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| New regulations | New languages and frameworks |
| Updated documentation templates | Novel problem-solving approaches |
| Incremental process changes | Fundamental paradigm shifts |
| Learning primarily through formal training | Learning through practice, community, and exploration |

### From Cost Center to Value Creator

Perhaps the most significant shift has been in how my work is perceived:

- **In IT audit**: My team was a necessary cost and compliance function
- **In development**: My work directly creates value for users and the business

This fundamental difference affects everything from how projects are approached to how my contributions are valued.

## What I Miss (and Don't Miss) About IT Audit

### What I Occasionally Miss

1. **Predictable hours**: Development deadlines can create their own version of crunch time
2. **Clear advancement path**: Progression in tech can be less structured
3. **Process certainty**: Knowing exactly what steps come next
4. **Client variety**: Seeing different organizations and industries

### What I Definitely Don't Miss

1. **Documentation for documentation's sake**
2. **The disconnect between finding and solving problems**
3. **The strict hierarchy and political navigation**
4. **The feeling that my work wasn't making anything better**

## Advice for IT Auditors Considering the Switch

If you're in IT audit (or a similar field) and considering a move to programming, here's what I wish I'd known:

### 1. Leverage Your Existing Skills

Your audit background provides valuable capabilities:

- **Attention to detail**: Crucial for debugging and quality code
- **Process understanding**: Valuable for designing systematic solutions
- **Regulatory knowledge**: Helpful for compliance-related development
- **Client communication**: Essential for understanding requirements

### 2. Be Prepared for Identity Adjustment

One of the hardest transitions wasn't technical—it was psychological. I went from being experienced and respected to being a complete novice. This requires:

- **Embracing the beginner's mindset**
- **Finding identity beyond professional status**
- **Accepting that growth will be nonlinear**
- **Developing resilience to constant learning challenges**

### 3. Practical Steps for Transition

Based on what worked for me:

1. **Start with structured fundamentals**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript or Python
2. **Build projects that showcase problem-solving ability**
3. **Develop an audit-to-tech resume that translates your skills**
4. **Prepare for technical interviews with daily practice**
5. **Network with other career-changers for moral support**

### 4. Set Realistic Expectations

The transition typically involves:

- **6-12 months** of serious learning before job readiness
- **3-6 months** of active job searching
- **Initial salary reduction** of 20-40% (temporarily)
- **1-2 years** to reach equivalent compensation

## The Return on Investment

Three years after making the switch, here's where things stand:

- **Professional satisfaction**: Significantly higher
- **Compensation**: Exceeded my previous IT audit salary after 2 years
- **Growth opportunities**: Much more varied and abundant
- **Day-to-day enjoyment**: Consistently better, even on challenging days

The initial investment of time and temporary salary reduction has paid dividends in career satisfaction, earning potential, and daily quality of life.

## Conclusion: Is It Worth It?

For me, the answer is an unequivocal yes. The transition from IT audit to programming wasn't just a career change—it was a fundamental shift in how I experience work. Instead of dreading Monday mornings, I now work on problems that engage my creativity and intellect. Instead of pushing papers, I build solutions that users actually use.

That's not to say programming is the right move for everyone in IT audit. Some people genuinely thrive in the structured, compliance-focused environment. The key is honest self-assessment about what kind of work truly engages you.

If you find yourself creating Excel macros to make your audit work more interesting, or if you're more curious about how systems work than whether they're documented correctly, it might be time to consider whether you're in the right field.

The path isn't easy, but for those who make the transition successfully, the professional fulfillment waiting on the other side makes every challenge worthwhile.
